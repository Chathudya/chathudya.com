                <p>
                    I‚Äôm a <strong>Software Quality Assurance Engineer</strong> passionate about crafting seamless
                    digital experiences. With over <strong>2 years of expertise</strong> in <strong>functional
                    testing</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and <strong>agile methodologies</strong>, I thrive on
                    making software flawless and user-friendly.

                <p>
                    Think of me as the üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong> of testing‚Äîbreaking things (intentionally,
                    of course) to ensure they don‚Äôt break when it matters most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, you‚Äôll find me immersed in üìö books, balancing productivity guides and testing
                    manuals with captivating fiction (<em>yes, I‚Äôm slightly obsessed with <strong>A Court of Thorns and
                    Roses</strong></em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What fuels me? <strong>Humor</strong>, <strong>thoughtful discussions</strong>, and the pursuit of
                    glitch-free apps‚Äîbecause every app deserves to shine! ‚ú®
